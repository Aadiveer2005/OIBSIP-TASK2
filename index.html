            <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
            <p>Gandhi was born into a Hindu family and was deeply influenced by his mother's devout religious beliefs. He traveled to London in 1888 to study law at University College London. It was during this time that he began to explore and integrate the teachings of various religious texts, which would later shape his philosophy of nonviolence.</p>

            <h2>Struggle for Indian Independence</h2>
            <p>Upon returning to India from South Africa in 1915, where he had fought against racial discrimination, Gandhi became a prominent leader in the Indian National Congress. He advocated for Swaraj, or self-rule, through peaceful protests, civil disobedience, and non-cooperation with the British authorities. His efforts culminated in the Salt March of 1930, a significant act of nonviolent resistance that galvanized the Indian population.</p>

            <h2>Gandhi's Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Gandhi's philosophy was rooted in the principles of truth (Satya) and nonviolence (Ahimsa). He believed that nonviolence was not just the absence of physical violence but also the avoidance of any form of harm or injustice. His teachings emphasized the importance of self-purification, moral integrity, and the relentless pursuit of truth. Gandhi's approach to social and political change was deeply spiritual, advocating for the upliftment of the oppressed through peaceful means.</p>

            <h2>Achievements and Legacy</h2>
            <p>Gandhi's leadership was instrumental in India achieving independence on August 15, 1947. His methods of nonviolent resistance influenced numerous civil rights movements around the world, including the American Civil Rights Movement led by Martin Luther King Jr. Today, Gandhi is remembered not only as a political leader but as a moral icon whose teachings continue to resonate globally. His birthday, October 2nd, is celebrated as the International Day of Non-Violence.</p>
